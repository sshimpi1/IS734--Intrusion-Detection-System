**Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning**
Welcome to the Intrusion Detection System Project, which uses current machine learning models to detect and mitigate network security threats. 
This project aims to simplify intrusion detection using cutting-edge algorithms on accessible tools.

**Overview**
This project will drive the development of a strong Intrusion Detection System using machine learning to achieve the following:
Detecting anomalies in network traffic. Distinguish the various normal activities from potential cyber-attacks.
Minimize false positives and negatives for reliable security.

**Key Features:**
It uses the NSL-KDD dataset, which results in high accuracy with less redundancy.
Integrates the process of dimensionality reduction using PCA for efficient computation.

**Models used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN and Support Vector Machines.

**Tools used:** Google Colab, and Python libraries.

**Project Structure**
data/: Contain datasets that were used for training and testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing and model training.
scripts/: Python scripts containing the implementation of various machine learning models.
results/: Outputs, performance metrics, and confusion matrices.

**Prerequisites**
